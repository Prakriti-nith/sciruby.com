My happiness knew no bounds when I received the email from ParisRB conf organizers regarding my selection as a speaker. Looking forward to it with much eagerness and enthusiasm.

ParisRB conf is a Europe's #1 ruby conference where you'll meet other fellow Rubyists and expand your horizon. The year 2020 marks the 25th Anniversary of the first release of Ruby and Ruby's creator Yukihiro Matsumoto will be presenting a Keynote speech to mark this event, followed by the other talks.

# Proposed Topic and Description

I feel honored to present the topic: "All-in-one interactive plotting using daru-view" at the conference. The proposal of my talk can be found [here](https://github.com/SciRuby/daru-view/wiki/All-in-one-interactive-plotting-using-daru-view). I will be covering the following topics in my presentation:

1. Brief introduction about Sciruby and what it does.
2. Ruby for data analysis and visualization
	* Recent developments
	* Different data visualization libraries that are available in Ruby and how daru-view is better.
3. Introduction to daru with examples
	* analyzing data sets using Daru::Dataframe and Daru::Datavector
	* importing and exporting data from/in different formats using daru-io
4. Introduction to daru-view
	* Explaining different plotting tools available in daru-view, comparing them and their features with examples in IRuby notebook and rails.
		* Google Charts
		* HighCharts
		* HighStock
		* HighMap
		* Datatables
		* Nyaplot
5. Show a real-life data-set example to import data using daru-io, analysis using daru and visualization using daru-view.
